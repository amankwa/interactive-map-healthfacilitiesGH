## Motivation:
The main motivation behind this simple shiny app is to make it easier to locate health facilities in Ghana along with other vital information.


## Data:
Data for the Health Facilities application is sourced from Open Government Data Platform. The original data is available as a csv file called "Health Facilities in Ghana". The raw data file, processed data file and my shiny code is made available on my github.

I have tried my best to comment and explain where necessary.


## Data limitation:
One of the limitations of this application is that the data is not accurate. If we plot the raw data we see a few health facility locations in Ghana. There are 1795 missing data out of the total of 3756 entries. Out of the missing data, 898 are coordinates(longitudes and latitudes).

Hence when we create the shiny application we will ignore these points. I am in a process to update these points.


## Help:
In case you observe the data projected on map is incorrect and you have more accurate or additional information that could be updated it will be great if you can email me (nanakwamester@gmail.com) and I will update the same.
